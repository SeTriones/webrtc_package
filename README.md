A bash script for packing webrtc(https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/) build results.(It works with build generated by gn. For gyp builds, refer: https://github.com/vsimon/webrtcbuilds)

How it works:

Find out all webrtc header files and jsoncpp header files(You can collect all the other third_party header files as you want).

Find out all the object files(\*.o), remove those for testing(This may look ugly), finally using ar to merge them into one static lib(libwebrtc_full.a).

How to enable H264:

If you build on out/Default

Write the following in args.gn:

	is_debug = false
	proprietary_codecs = true
	rtc_use_h264 = true
	ffmpeg_branding = "Chrome"
